# McDonald-s-Menu-Nutritional-Analysis---Project

This project aims to analyze the nutritional content of McDonald's menu items to provide insights benefiting both customers and the organization. By understanding the nutritional profiles, customers can make informed choices aligning with their dietary preferences and health goals. For McDonald's, this analysis can guide menu development, introducing healthier options and catering to diverse nutritional needs. By identifying menu items with the highest and lowest calorie counts and determining their popularity among customers, McDonald's can tailor its offerings to better meet consumer demands while promoting healthier eating habits. This data-driven approach not only enhances customer satisfaction but also supports McDonald's efforts to promote health and wellness within its brand image.
